## Build your [First PWA](https://pwabuzz.web.app/)

Learn how to build your first progressive web app with [pwafire.org](https://pwafire.org) in [this starter codelab](
https://pwafire.org/developer/codelabs/pwafire/)

 - In this codelab, you'll be able to build a progressive web app with mostly static resources or meant to work best for static web apps or sites.

## Using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) instead 
We will be adding a more advanced codelab to help you learn how to build Progressive Web Apps that are dynamic or for large scale production scenario by having the power to :

  - choose what to cache

  - dictate how to cache

  - decide how long to cache

  - decide when to cache

  - decide what resources to cache

  - decide how much of a resource to cache 

## Demo in play...
